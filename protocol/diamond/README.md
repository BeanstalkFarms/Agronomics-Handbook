# Diamond

The Diamond Module handles all functions that require ownership permission in Beanstalk. These are functions that only the owner address can call. This includes adding and removing assets from the Deposit Whitelist, Pausing and Unpausing Beanstalk and upgrading Beanstalk with Diamond Cuts.

See [EIP-2535 Diamond](../../overview/eip-2535-diamond.md) to read more about Beanstalk's upgradable proxy implementation.
