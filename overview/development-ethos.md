# Development Ethos

Decentralized blockchains like Ethereum impose extreme computational and storage limitations. While centralized computation solutions allow the performance of advanced statistical models on gigabytes of data, decentralized systems force users to pay for every byte stored and basic arithmetic operation performed on-chain.

Decentralized systems will scale infinitely over time, eventually allowing users to perform large scale machine learning operations on decentralized permissionless architectures. However, it's imperative to start building, experimenting with and iterating on the financial primitives that will define the foundations of decentralized ecosystems built on permissionless systems. Otherwise, they will likely merely mimic those of the centralized world. Beanstalk is an attempt at implementing a decentralized permissionless fiat currency designed to become the basis of the rent-free economy permissionless technology is ushering in.&#x20;

No one wants to be limited, but resource scarcity forces innovation. Ethereum does not lend itself to trading on order books. Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and [Bancor](https://home.bancor.network/) created liquidity pools priced on a predefined pricing curve to create an efficient exchange format instead of a high frequency order book.&#x20;

AMMs are still being iterated and innovated on. Uniswap created an order book/AMM hybrid with Uniswap V3. [Curve](https://curve.fi/) implemented capital efficient pricing curves. Bancor built an omnipool, providing impermanent loss protection. Beanstalk will support a 0% fee AMM.

Open source protocols are a public good. More than [250](https://defillama.com/forks) protocols have forked Uniswap V2 to try to improve on its model. Some may call it competitive, but it is also collaborative. Each implementation is more advanced than its previous iteration and is made possible through increasingly efficient allocation of EVM resources.

Question everything, be critical, and collaborate.
