# Agronomics Handbook

The **Agronomics Handbook** is a collection of technical documentation about Beanstalk.

Beanstalk forms the monetary basis of an Ethereum-native, rent-free economy facilitated by the seigniorage of its native fiat currency, a stablecoin called Bean.

Beanstalk strives to create product market fit on both a technical and economic level.

Beanstalk pioneers a path forward for devising more efficient and complex systems. Beanstalk is implemented in [Solidity v0.7.6](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) for intended use in the [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/). Beanstalk leverages [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) to minimize gas costs and complexity.

The contract code can be found below. Beanstalk is deployed at [`0xC1E088fC1323b20BCBee9bd1B9fC9546db5624C5`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc1e088fc1323b20bcbee9bd1b9fc9546db5624c5).
