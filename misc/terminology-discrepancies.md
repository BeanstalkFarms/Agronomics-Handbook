# Terminology Discrepancies



In the Beanstalk ecosystem, **Internal Balances** are referred to as **Farm Balances**. Similarly, **External Balances** (balances in the user's wallet) are referred to as **Circulating Balances**. See [Terminology Discrepancies](terminology-discrepancies.md).



These discrepancies can be resolved in a future BIP.
