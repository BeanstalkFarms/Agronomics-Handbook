# Terminology Discrepancies

The Beanstalk codebase currently uses several terms that are out of date with the whitepaper, the Beanstalk UI, the Farmers' Almanac, etc. The following is a list of outdated terminology used in the Beanstalk codebase and the associated proper terms.

These discrepancies can be resolved in a future BIP.
